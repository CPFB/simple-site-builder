This repository will include a Rails project that is the backbone for a user interface for non-techies to build an elegant website.

Planned features include:
- custom routing for user generated pages (included currently)
- custom templating system
- allowing other Rails code to be implemented easily via typical Rails development
- easy page composition/editing through the use of BBcode (included currently)
- page revision history

Thanks to http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/ for most of the icons found in the bbcode text editor.
