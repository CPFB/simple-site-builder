This repository will include a Rails project that is the backbone for a user interface for non-techies to build an elegant website.

Planned features include:
custom routing for user generated pages
custom templating system
allowing other Rails code to be implemented easily via typical Rails development
easy page composition/editing through the use of BBcode (instead of html)
page revision history
